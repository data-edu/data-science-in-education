# Teaching Data Science

This book is focused on the application of data science to education. In other words, this book focuses on how to apply data science to questions of teaching, learning, and educational systems. The previous chapters have addresses these topics narratively and in the form of walk-throughs for common questions (or problems) and the types of data encountered in education. 

While this book is focused on applying data science to education, an important consideration for data science is how to teach others about it. This is particularly the case for a book that is by a team of authors who are involved in education. Also, we expect readers of this book - many who will also be involved in education - will be interested in teaching others about data science.

This chapter, then, focuses on teaching data science to others. This chapter is organized around three topics, which progress from concrete and specific (with reference to pedagogical approach we used to guide how we wrote this book) to more general ideas and findings from educational research about teaching and learning.

<!-- Not sure this organization works - may want to move general strategies first or second, and have teaching data science be last? -->

## The pedagogical principles this book is based upon

As the authors of a book about data science in education - and readers of books that taught us about data science - we considered what would make it effective for our readers when we set out to write it. The result of this process was a pedagogical framework that consists of three principles: problem-based learning, differentiation, and universal design. We consider each of these in turn.

### Problem-based learning 

Problem-based learning (PBL) is a method of instruction that presents learners with a real-world challenge in which they must apply their skills and knowledge to solve. We applied this principle to the design of this book through including walk-throughs for common questions with respect to data science and education. Whereas some topics may benefit less from such an approach (and the inclusion of walk-throughs), for data science, we believe this is important because we do not have all of the right answers in this text. Moreover, there is not one right statistical model or algorithm, a technique to write code or even software and tools to utilize. 

Thus, the text features walkthroughs that reflect the types of challenges that educational data scientists may encounter in the course of their work: readers may choose to go about approaching the analysis of the data used in each walkthrough differently. At the end of walkthrough, there exist exercises that provide the opportunity for readers to extend and apply the ideas presented in the chapter. Moreover, the challenges are structured in such a way that readers return to some of them, but with different aims, over the course of the book.

<!-- Josh: To what extent do we need to change the walkthroughs or their order to make this accurate? -->

<!-- Josh: Wonder if we add another paragraph about how others can apply problem-based learning in any setting? -->

<!-- Jesse: talking more about the general principles of PBL within a data science//programming setting might be useful (I'm thinking mostly about metacognitive skills) -->

### Differentiation

Differentiation is a method for providing multiple pathways for learners to engage with, understand, and ultimately apply new content and new skills. To differentiate this text, we first created personas for who we expected to be common groups of readers of the book (see @wilson2009 [https://teachtogether.tech/] for an example). We then differentiate the book by recognizing and providing background content/skills (either explicitly or through reference to other resources), embedded checks for understanding, and recommendations for where to begin based upon prior expertise. We also provide screenshots that are annotated and reflective of the content in the text to help to show readers how they are able to use what they are reading about.

<!-- Say more about this - specifically how we use the user personas? -->

Part of differentiating this book concerns for whom we are differentiating it. We consider inclusivity (in terms of who belongs as a part of the audience for this text and how this broader view of who participates in data science implies the types of challenges, topics, and data that we include in the book) and accessibility (technically, in terms of how a wide audience of readers is able to access and use the book, as well as in terms of the ways in which the content is written based on the unique assets that those in education bring) along with how we differentiate the book. 

### Universal Design 

Universal design is a series of principles which guide the creation of spaces that are inclusive and accessible to individuals from all walks of life regardless of age, size, ability, or disability [@steinfeld2012]. While traditionally applied to physical spaces, we have extended these principles to the creation of this book in such a way that the text and accompanying materials will be designed for individuals from all walks of life, regardless of educational level, background, ability, or disability. 

Many of the seven guiding principles of Universal Design are readily transferable to the creation of a text, such as equitable use, flexibility in use (aided in large part through differentiation), simple and intuitive use, perceptible information, and tolerance for error.

<!-- Say more regarding how we apply these? -->

<!-- Also say how this can be applied more generally? -->

### Working in the Open

We started writing this book in the open, on GitHub. This allowed us to share the book as it developed. Writing the book in the open also allowed others from the wider educational data science and data science community to contribute. These contributions included writing sections of the book in which contributors had specific expertise, asking clarifying questions, and, even, creating a logo for the book which informed our choice of a color palette. We decided to write this book in the open after witnessing the success of other books on data science (such as @wickham2019advr *Advanced R* (https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) book.

## Strategies for teaching data science

You may be interested in teaching others' data science. You may be doing this informally (such as by teaching a colleague with whom you work in your school district or organization), in a formal environment (such as a class on data science for educational data scientists or analysts), or in some setting in-between (such as a workshop you are asked to provide). There is some research on teaching data science, as well as practical advice from experienced instructors that can inform these efforts, which we detail in this section.

### Provide a home base for learners to access resources (and to learn more)

As we discuss in the next section, along with other important factors (such as learners' motivation and having a supportive atmospher), learning strategies can make a difference for learners. Especially when it comes to learning to do data science, there are many tools and resources to keep track of, such as:

- How to download and install R
- How to download and install R Studio
- How to install packages
- How to access resources related to the workshop or course (or simply other resources you wish to share)
- How to contact the instructor 
- How to get help and learn more

Having a "home base," where you can remind learners to first look to for resources, can help to lower some of learners' demands in terms of remembering how these tools and resources can be accessed. One way to do this is through a personal website. Another is through GitHub pages. For some organizations, a proprietary learning management system - such as Desire2Learn, Blackboard, Moodle, or Canvas - can be helpful (especially if your learners are accustomed to using them).

### When it comes to writing code, think early and often

It is important to get learners to start writing code early and often. It can be tempting to teach classes or workshops that front-load content about data science and using R. While this information is doubtlessly important, it can mean that those you are teaching do not have the chance to do the things that they want to do, including installing R (and R Studio) and beginning to run analyses. Because of this, we recommend starting with strategies that lower the barrier to writing code for learners. Ways to do this in teaching settings include:

- Using R Studio Cloud
- Providing an R Markdown document for learners to work through
- Providing a data set and ideas for how to begin exploring it

While these strategies are especially helpful for courses or workshops, they can be translated to teaching and learning R in tutoring (or "one-on-one") opportunities for learners. In these cases, being able to work through and to modify an existing analysis (perhaps in R Studio Cloud) can be a way to quickly begin to run analyses - and to use the analysis as a template for analyses associated with other projects. Also, having a data set associated with a project or analysis - and a real need to analyze it using R - can be an outstanding way for an individual to learn to use R. 

### Don't touch that keyboard!

Resist helping learners to the point of hindering their learning. @wilson2009 writes about the way in which those teaching others about R - or to program, in general - can find it easier to correct errors in learners' work. But, by fixing errors, learners' may perceive themselves to not be capable of carrying out all of the steps needed in an analysis on their own. 

This strategy relates to a broader issue, as well: issues that have to do with writing code in a way that runs correctly (e.g., with the correct capitalization and syntax) can be minor to those with experience programming, but can be major barriers to using R in an independent way for those new to it. For example, becoming comfortable with where arguments to functions belong and how to separate them, how to use brackets belong in functions or loops, and when it is necessary to use an assignment operator can be *completely new* to beginners: doing these steps for learners may push their learning later when they do not have as many resources available to help them than when you are teaching them. So, consider taking the additional time needed to help learners to navigate minor issues and errors in their code: it can pay off in increased motivation on their part in the longer-term.

### Anticipate issues (and sacrifice accuracy for clarity)

Don't worry about being perfectly accurate early on, especially if doing so would lead to learners who are less interested in the topic you are teaching. For example, there are complicated issues at the heart of why data that is built-in to packages or to R (such as the iris dataset) appear in the environment after they are first used in an R session (see the section on "promises" in @wickham2019advr). Similarly, there are complicated issues that pertain to how functions are evaluated that can explain why it is important to provide the name of packages installed via `install.packages()` (whereas the names of arguments to othe functions, such as `dplyr::select()` do not need to be quoted).

In these cases, wherein additional details may not be helpful to beginners, it can be valuable to important these questions (and the issues that are assocaited with them), but to have responses or answers that provide more clarity, rather than confusion. 

For example,

### Start lessons or activities with visualizing data

There are examples from data science books @grolemund2018 and past research (e.g. @lehrer2015) that suggests that starting with visualizing data can be benefician in terms of learners' ability to work with data. @golemund2018 write that they begin their book, *Data Science Using R*, with a chapter on visualization, because doing so allows learners to create something that they can share immediately, whereas tasks such as loading data can be rife with issues - and does not immediately lead learners to have a product they can share. @lehrer2007 show how providing students with an opportunity to invent statistics by displaying the data in new ways. This led to (productive) critique among fifth- and sixth-grade students and their teacher.

### Consider representation in the data and examples you use

One way to think about data is that it is objective, free of decisions about what to value or prioritize. Another is to consider data as a process that is value-laden, from deciding what question to ask (and what data to collect) to interpreting findings with attention to how others will make sense of them (e.g., @oneill2016's *Weapons of Math Destruction*, and @lehrer2007's description of data modeling). From this broader view, choosing representative data is a choice, like others, that teachers can make. For example, instructors can choose data that directs attention to issues-- equity-related issues in education, for example--that she or he believes would be valuable for students to analyze.

We think this consideration is important - particularly when it comes to data-related issues that we consider to be objective, such as how variables are assumed and constructed to be dichotomous (such as variables for individual's gender) or categorical (such as variables for individual's race), when the truth may be that such variables are based on decisions that analysts or those collecting data made - decisions that may benefit from questioning. This consideration is also important when it comes to what data is used for teaching and learning. If names of individual's in data exclusively from individuals from majority racial or ethnic group, for example, some learners may implicitly perceive the content being taught to be designed for others. While we may think that such issues are better left to those we are teaching to decide later on, setting the stage in classes, courses, and other contexts in which data science is taught and learned can set an important precedent for the data our learners use and how they use it.

### Draw on other resources

In this section of this chapter, we presented some strategies for teaching data science. There are others that go more into depth on this topic from different perspectives, such as the following: 

- [GAISE Guidelines](https://www.amstat.org/asa/education/Guidelines-for-Assessment-and-Instruction-in-Statistics-Education-Reports.aspx): guidelines for teaching statistics
- [Data Science for Undergraduates](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25104/data-science-for-undergraduates-opportunities-and-options): a report on undergraduate data science education
- R Studio Education: https://education.rstudio.com/

There are also a number of data science-related curricula (for the K-12 level) which may be helpful:

## General strategies related to teaching and learning

<!-- Needs to emphasize pedagogical principles more/better -->

<!-- Jesse: what I'm not seeing in our resources are pedagogical texts related to classroom instruction - I would argue that K-12 education has largely provided the answers to "How do we teach data science?" question, but yet data science continues to recreate the wheel. I would add in resources by Hattie (Visible Learning), Lemov (TLAC 2.0), and potentially Bambrick, along with "Understanding by Design Meets Neuroscience" by McTighe and Willis (the original, Understanding by Design, was done by Wiggins & McTighe) -->

The National Academy of Science commissioned a report, *How People Learn* [@nrc2000], that aimed to summarize research from the educational psychology and the learning sciences on teaching and learning. In 2018, the book was updated in *How People Learn II* [@nrc2018], which aimed to emphasize the social and cultural aspects of teaching and learning, which were not as much the focus of the earlier report. In this section, we highlight general strategies related to teaching and learning from the latest report (abbreviated as *HPL2*), with an emphasis on strategies applicable to teaching and learning data science. 

### Teaching and learning are complex

One principle that *HPL2* begins with is that learning is complex. in short, learning is not just about what learners know, or think, but is also about developmental, cultural, contextual, and historical factors - and distinctions between individuals with respect to each of these factors. This is an asset to teachers, as the authors of the report state: learners bring resources that can serve as a starting point for their learning trajectory when it comes to data science. These distinctions also mean that educators need to be concerned with - and to consider within their purview - factors well beyond what learners know, but also what their prior educational experiences have been and what resources and other individuals they have access to at work and at home, for example.

<!-- Not satisifed with this. -->

### Learners learn many different things (consciously and unconsciously)

We often think of learning in terms of objectives for specific lessons, but learners learn many different things at different times. The authors of *HPL2* point out that individuals learn in response to different challenges and circumstances, including those in formal learning environements, such as workshops or classes. This principle implies a strategy that involves supporting learners to do data science, however and whenever they learn it. This means that it is both okay - and even to be expected - that learners may take away more from a problem they try to solve on their own, than what they do from a workshop or class (or even a degree!). This also suggests that learners may learn things that we do not anticipate, such as how intructors try to solve problems that arise in class.

### Metacognition is important (even though it sounds more sophisticated than it is!)

Educators and educational researchers often talk about metacognition, or thinking (and ideas) about thinking, as if it is something only very sophisticated learners do, but it is truly something much more commonplace, as people (and learners) are thinking about what they are learning and doing regularly. One strategy for instructors to support metacognition is to include moments wherein learners are asked to consider what they learned and what they would like to learn more about (exit tickets can be a great way to do this, but brief period in-class can also be used). Another strategy is to help learners to recognize when it is important to ask for help: Often, when doing data science, the right question to the right person (or community) can save hours of work.

### Learning strategies matter

While teachers are responsible for designing learning opportunities, learners also play an important role - in their own learning! Learning strategies, according to the authors of *HPL2*, matter, including those that help students to retrieve information and summarize and explain what they have learned (for themseleves and othres). There are many specific strategies documented in [chapter four](https://www.nap.edu/read/24783/chapter/6#72) of *HPL2*. What is important for teachers of data science to know is less the specific strategies, and more the commitment to teaching learners how to learn. 

In addition to strategies for learners, teaching strategies, such as how content is spaced and sequenced, can also help learners. @dierksen2015's *Design for How People Learn* presents these strategies, based largely about instructional design research, that may be helpful to those teaching data science.

### Educators can help students to learn

Educators know that how motivated learners are matters. According to the authors of *HPL2*, teachers can make an impact on how motivated learners are. Some specific things that educators can do to support learners include helping learners to set (and to work toward) goals, selecting content that is valuable and interesting to learners, helping learners to have choices and showing them how they are  in-control of their learning value, and supporting learners to feel good at and supported in what they are doing. In short, motivation matters, and may be especially important when teaching learners who do not see the value of data science (initially!).

<!-- Jesse: my big wondering is how we can make it more actionable, as it reads largely as theoretical. I'm wondering if, based on how we're setting up the text, it would be more effective to provide context (as in the various paragraphs) and then 2 - 5 action steps, so that readers can choose what works for them and immediately start to put it into practice. -->

<!-- Josh: need to add action steps -->

## Summary

In this section, we described the pedagogical principles for this book and strategies for teaching data science. We also directed attention to more general strategies for teaching and learning. Teaching data science is a relatively new area, but data science educators are not alone, given resources that are beign developed and those that can be adapted from other disciplines and the wider body of educational research.
