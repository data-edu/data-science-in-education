## Learning Data Science in Education {#c01}

Over the coming chapters we'll be learning together about what data science in education can look like. But to understand why we were compelled to write about the topic, we need to talk about why data science in education is not such a straightforward thing. 

Learning data science in education is challenging because there isn't a universal vision for that role yet. Data science in education isn't straightforward because the role itself is not straightforward. If education were a building, it would be multi-storied with many rooms. There are privately and publicly funded schools. There are more than eighteen possible grade levels. Students can learn alone or with others in a classroom. 

This imaginary building we call education also has rooms most residents never see: Business and finance staff plan the most efficient use of limited funds. The transportation department plans bus routes across vast spaces. University administrators search for the best way to measure career readiness. Education consultants study how students perform on course work and even how they feel about class materials. 

There are a lot of ways one *could* do data science in education, but building consensus on ways one *should* do data science in education is just getting started. The data science in education community is still working out how it all fits together. And for someone just getting started, it can all seem very overwhelming. 

Even if we did have perfectly clarity on the topic, there's still the issue of helping education systems learn to leverage these new analytic tools. In many education settings, school administrators and their staff may have never had someone around [who understands education, knows how to code, and uses statistical techniques [@conway2010data] all at once. 

## Making the Path a Little Clearer

As data science in education grows, the way we talk about and conceptualize it [@rosenberg2020mdsc] also needs to grow. We begin this book by offering a primer for data science in education, including a discussion of unique challenges and foundational skills in the programming language R. 

Next, you'll take what you've learned and apply it in our data analysis in education walkthroughs. The walkthroughs in this book are our contribution towards a more example-driven approach to learning. They're meant to make the ambiguous path of learning data science in education a little clearer by way of recognizable and actionable demonstrations. These examples fall into three different education data themes, with walkthroughs for each theme:

Student perceptions of learning

* [Walkthrough 1: The Education Dataset Science Pipeline](#c07)
* [Walkthrough 5: Text Analysis With Social Media Data](#c16)
* [Walkthrough 7: The Role (and Usefulness) of Multi-Level Models](#c13)

Analyze student performance data  

* [Walkthrough 2: Approaching Gradebook Data From a Data Science Perspective ](#c08)
* [Walkthrough 8: Predicting Students' Final Grades Using Machine Learning Methods](#c14)

Get value from publicly available data  

* [Walkthrough 3: Introduction to Aggregate Data](#c09)
* [Walkthrough 4: Longitudinal Analysis With Federal Students With Disabilities Data](#c10)

We'll end the book by discussing how to bring data science skills into your education job.

We hope after reading this book you'll feel like you're not alone in learning to do data science in education. We hope your experience with this book is challenging, but fun. And finally, we hope you'll take what you learned and share it with others who are looking to start this journey.
