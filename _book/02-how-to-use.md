# How to Use this Book {#c02}

We've heard it from fellow data scientists and experienced it ourselves---learning a programming language is hard. Like
learning a foreign language, it is not just about mastering vocabulary. It's also
about learning the language's norms, its underlying structure, and the metaphors
that hold the whole thing together.

The beginning of the learning journey is particularly challenging because it
feels slow. If you have experience as an educator or consultant, you already
have efficient solutions you use in your day-to-day work. Introducing code to
your workflow slows you down at first because you won't be as fast as you are
with your favorite spreadsheet software. However, you're probably reading this book because you realize that learning how to analyze data using R is like investing in your own personal infrastructure---it takes time while you're building the initial skills, but the investment pays off when you start solving complex problems faster and at scale. One person we spoke with shared this story about their learning journey:

> The first six months were hard. I knew how quickly I could do a pivot table
> in Excel. It took longer in R because I had to go through the syntax and take
> the book out. I forced myself to do it, though. In the long term, I'd be a
> better data scientist. I'm so glad I thought that way, but it was hard the
> first few months.

Our message is this: learning R for your education job is doable, challenging,
and rewarding all at once. We wrote this book for you because we do this work
every day. We're not writing as education data science masters. We're writing as
people who learned R and data science *after* we chose education. And like you,
improving the lives of students is our daily practice. Learning to use R and data
science helped us do that. Join us in enjoying all that comes with R and data science---both the challenge of
learning and the joy of solving problems in creative and efficient ways.

## Different Strokes for Different Data Scientists in Education

As we learned in the introduction, it's tough to define data science in education 
because people are educated in all kinds of settings and in all kinds of age groups. Education organizations
require different roles to make it work, which creates different kinds of data
science uses. A teacher's approach to data analysis is different from an
administrator's or an operations manager's. 

We also know that learning data science and R is not in the typical job
description. Most readers of this book are educators working with data and
looking to expand their tools. You might even be an educator who *doesn't*
work with data, but you've discovered a love for learning about the lives of
students through data. Either way, learning data science and R is probably not
in your job description.

Like most professionals in education, you've got a full work schedule and
challenging demands in the name of improving the student experience. Your busy
workday doesn't include regular professional development time or self-driven
learning. You also have a life outside of work, including family, hobbies, and
relaxation. We struggle with this ourselves, so we've designed this book to be
used in lots of different ways. The important part in learning this material is
to establish a routine that allows you to engage and practice the content every
day, even if for just a few minutes at a time. That will make the content 
ever-present in your mind and will help you shift your mindset so you start seeing
even more opportunities for practice.

We want all readers to have a rewarding experience, and so we believe there
should be different ways to use this book. Here are some of those ways:

### Read the Book Cover to Cover (and How to Keep Going)

We wrote this book assuming you're at the start of your journey learning R and
using data science in your education job. The book takes you from installing R
to practicing more advanced data science skills like text analysis.

If you've never written a line of R code, we welcome you to the community! We
wrote this book for you. Consider reading the book cover to cover and doing all
the analysis walkthroughs. Remember that you'll get more from a few minutes of
practice every day than you will from long hours of practice every once in
a while. Typing code every day, even if it doesn't always run, is a daily practice
that invites learning and "a-ha" moments. We know how easy it is to avoid coding
when it doesn't feel successful (we've been there), so we've designed this book to deliver frequent
small wins to keep the momentum going. But even then, we all eventually hit a
wall in our learning. When that happens, take a break and then come back and
keep coding. When daily coding becomes a habit, so does the learning.

If you get stuck in an advanced chapter and you need a break, try reviewing an
earlier chapter. You'll be surprised at how much you learn from reviewing old
material with the benefit of new experiences. Sometimes that kind of back-to-basics
attitude is what we need to get a fresh perspective on new challenges.

### Pick a Chapter of Interest and Start There

We interviewed R users in education as research for this book. We chose people
with different levels of experience in R, in the education field, and in statistics.
We asked each interviewee to rate their level of experience on a scale from 1
to 5, with 1 being "no experience" and 5 being "very experienced". You can try this
now---take a moment to rate your level of experience in:

  - Using R
  - Education as a field
  - Statistics

If you rated yourself as a 1 in Using R, we recommend reading the book from
beginning to end as part of a daily practice. If you rated yourself higher than
a 1, consider reviewing the table of contents and skimming all the
chapters first. If a particular chapter calls to you, feel free to start your
daily practice there. Eventually, we do hope you choose to experience the whole
book, even if you start somewhere in the middle.

For example, you might be working through a specific use case in your education
job---perhaps you are analyzing student quiz scores, evaluating a school program, introducing a data science technique to your teammates, or designing data dashboards. If this describes your situation, feel free to find a section in the
book that inspires you or shows you techniques that apply to your project.

This book is primarily about learning to use R as a tool for data science in education. Your experience level with R should be the main factor when you decide how to enjoy the book. But do consider how you rated your level of experience with education and statistics. If these are areas you want to focus on, take your time understanding the education scenarios and statistics techniques we describe. All three disciplines are important parts of being a data scientist in education. 

### Read Through the Walkthroughs and Run the Code

If you're experienced in data analysis using R, you may be interested in
starting with the walkthroughs. Each walkthrough is designed to demonstrate
basic analytic routines using datasets that look familiar to people working in the education field.

In this approach, we suggest readers be intentional about what they want to
learn from the walkthroughs. For example, readers may seek out examples of
aggregated datasets, exploratory data analysis, the {ggplot2} package, or the
`pivot_longer()` function. Read the walkthrough and run the code in your R console as
you go. After you successfully run the code, experiment with the functions and
techniques you learned by changing the code and seeing new results (or new error
messages!). After running the code in the walkthroughs, reflect on how what you
learned can be applied to the datasets, problems, and analytic routines in your
education work.

One last note on this approach to the book: we believe that doing data science in education
using R is, at its heart, an endeavor aimed at improving the student experience. The skills taught in the
walkthroughs are only one part of doing data science in education using R.
As an experienced R user, you know that this endeavor involves complex problems and collaboration. Since part of your task may be to convince others around you of the merits of your analytic tools and approaches, we've written this book with that context in mind. [Chapter 15](#c15) in particular explores ways to introduce these skills to your education
job and invite others into analytic activities. We believe you'll glean useful perspectives from chapters on concepts you're already familiar with, too.

## A Note on Statistics
Data science is the intersection between content expertise,
programming, and statistics. You'll want to grow all three of these as you learn
more about using data science in your education job. Your education knowledge
will lead you to the right problems, your statistics skills will bring rigor to
your analysis, and your programming skills will scale your analysis to reach
more people.

What happens when we remove one of these pieces? Consider a data scientist
working in education who is an expert programmer and statistician but has not
learned about the real-life conditions that generate education data. She might
make analysis decisions that overlook the nuances in the data. As another example, consider a data
scientist who is an expert statistician and an education veteran, but who has not
learned to code. He will find it difficult to scale his analysis up, thereby foregoing the chance to make the
largest possible improvement to the student experience. Finally,
consider a data scientist who is an expert programmer and an education veteran.
She can only scale surface-level analysis and might miss chances to understand causal
relationships or predict student outcomes.

In this book, we will spend a lot of time learning R by way of recognizable
education data examples. But doing a deep dive into statistics and how to use
statistical techniques responsibly is better covered by books dedicated solely to the topic. It's
hard to overstate how important this part of the learning is on the lives of
students and educators. One education data scientist we spoke to said this about
the difference between building a model for an online retailer and building a
model in education:

>It’s not a big deal if an online shopper gets mistakenly shown 1000 brooms but if I got my model wrong and we close a school, that will change a child's entire life.

We want this book to be your go-to R reference as you start integrating data
science tools into your education job. Our aim is to help you learn R by
teaching data science techniques using education
datasets. We'll demonstrate statistics techniques like hypothesis testing and
model building and how to run these operations in R. However, the explanations in our chapters will not provide a complete background about the statistical techniques. 

We wrote within these boundaries because we believe that the technical and
ethical use of statistics techniques deserves its own space. If you already have a foundation in statistics, you will learn how to implement some familiar processes in R. If you have no foundation in statistics, you will be able to take a satisfying leap forward in your learning by successfully using R to run the models and experiencing the model interpretations in our
walkthroughs. We provide enough background for you to understand the purpose of the analysis and its results. We encourage you to explore other excellent books like [*Learning Statistics With R*](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) (https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) [@learningstatswithr], as you learn the required nuances of applying statistical techniques to scenarios outside our walkthroughs.

## What This Book Is Not About

While we wrote *Data Science in Education Using R* to be a wide-ranging introduction
to the topic, there is a great deal that this book is not about. Some of these topics 
are those that we would have liked to have been able to include, but we did not because they did 
not fit our intention of providing a solid foundation in doing data science in education. 
We chose to not include other topics because, frankly, excellent resources for those topics already exist. We
detail some of what we had to not include in the book here.

- Git/GitHub: Git and GitHub are version control software programs, which means that they help keep track of different versions of coding files and specific changes that were made for each version. Git and GitHub are parts of many data scientists' workflows for solo or collaborative work. However, there is a steep learning curve and these tools are not necessary to get started with coding in R. An outstanding introduction to Git and Github is @bryan2020's freely available book [*Happy Git with R*](https://happygitwithr.com/) (https://happygitwithr.com/).

- Building R packages: If you are carrying out the same analyses many times, it may be helpful to create your own package. Packages are collections of code and sometimes data, such as the {roomba} (for tidying complex, nested lists) and {tidyLPA} (for carrying out Latent Profile Analysis) packages that authors of this book created. However, building an R package is not the focus of this book. Hadley Wickham wrote a very helpful---and freely available---book on the topic called [*R Packages*](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) [@rpackages].

- Advanced statistical methodologies: As noted above, there are other excellent books for learning 
statistics. While we do discuss basic and advanced statistical methods, this is not a statistical methods book. One advanced statistical book that we think is excellent from a machine learning perspective is @james2013's *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*.

- Creating a website (or book): As you might already suspect, R is versatile and can be used for more than just performing data analyses. In fact, R can be used to write books (like this one, which we wrote using the {bookdown} package) and create websites (which some of the authors have done using the {blogdown} package). This book does not describe how to create books or websites; there are excellent, freely available books on these topics as well (see @xie2019blogdown's *blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown* (https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and @xie2019bookdown's *bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown* (https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

## Contributing to the Book

We designed this book to be useful and practical for our readers in education. We wrote it as a guide to getting up and running in R, but we know this book does not comprehensively cover every topic related to R. We did this to create a
reference that is not intimidating to new users and that creates frequent,
small wins while learning to use R.

One question we asked ourselves was: how do we expand this work as data science in education expands as a field? We want readers of this book to be equipped with an agile skillset, and we want this book to continue to provide that even as new R packages are developed and new methods arise. We wrote this book in the open on GitHub so that community members can help us
evolve the work, even after it is formally published. 

We want this to be the book new data scientists in education have with them as
they grow their craft. To achieve that goal, it's important to us that the stories and
examples in the book are based on **your** stories and examples. Therefore, we've
built ways for you to share with us.

If you have some experience with Git and want to contribute that way, here's how you can contribute:

  - Submit an "issue" to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education) (https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education/issues) that describes
    a data science problem that is unique to the education setting 
  - Submit a pull request to share a solution for the problems discussed in the
    book to the education setting
  - Share an anonymized dataset for use in the book (or a future version of it)

If you are new to data science in education, welcome! We would love to have your feedback by [email](mailto:authors@datascienceineducation.com) (authors@datascienceineducation.com). 

We hope that as the book evolves, it grows to reflect the
changing needs of data scientists in education.
