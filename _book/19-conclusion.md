# Conclusion: To where next? {#c19}

At the conclusion of this book, we hope that you feel ready to take on the data-
related question or problem you have wanted to address. We think that the work
that you will do is important. In education, particularly, there is a lot of
promise for how data can be used - by teachers, administrators, parents, and
even by students. There is also some peril, though, especially if data is used
that does not align with the goals and values of educators - and individually
and collectively learning and changing. As you work toward that goal, we wish to
offer some closing thoughts.

## Take on challenges

Many of the things that you surely want to do are likely beyond the realm of
what is possible now. These challenges, from the social (the problem you are
addressing is incredibly hard) and organizational (if your organization is not
ready for the types of work you are trying to do) to the technical (perhaps what
you want to do has literally never been done before), can be really difficult to
tackle.

One small suggestion we have is to tell a friend. When you're frustrated, having
a group you can turn to can be valuable. Relatedly, when R tells you that `NULL
is not TRUE` (or any one of innumerable pain points), try to laugh. It is so
common when doing data science to run into these frustrations that social media
accounts have emerged to chronicle them (see
[@accidentalaRt](https:/twitter.com/accidentalart))! Everyone, from the most
experienced R coder (Hadley Wickham has mentioned this many times) to the person
using R for the first time constantly runs into difficulties when trying
something new - you are not alone! So, take on challenges: a joy of doing data
science is that it is a field at this time, especially in education, is that the
promise and peril of using data are both very real, and those taking on
challenges have the chance to shape the direction of how data is used

## Know when to turn to something else

In addition to taking on challenges (and turning to friends and laughing), we
want to acknowledge everyone needs a break. Sometimes, instead of writing one
last line of R code, it can be better to do something else! An implication of
this is that leaving off so that you can pick back up where you stopped is
important. But, by doing so, you can live to code another day. We need as many
data scientists working in different corners of education as possible, and we
don't want to lose you to burn-out!

Similarly, when working on any project - even (mand aybe particularly those you
are passionate about - it can be important to switch to something else (data
science-related or otherwise) to retain the curiosity, passion, and interest
that brought you to the work in the first place. Consider working on a different
project or even taking a break from a project to pursue another hobby or
interest.

That curiosity, passion, and interest for educational and social (and data
science in education-related) topics is important to cultivate - perhaps as
important as the capabilities that this book focused on.
