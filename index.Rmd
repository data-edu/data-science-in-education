## Prologue {-}

There‚Äôs this story going around the internet about an eagle egg that hatches on a chicken farm. The eagle egg hatches near the chicken eggs. The local hens are so busy doing their thing that they don‚Äôt notice the baby eagle egg is not their own. The eagle chick is born and, having no knowledge of its own eagleness, joins its new family on a nervous and exciting first day of life. Over the next few years the baby eagle lives as chickens live. It eats chicken feed, learns to fly in short, choppy hops, and masters the rapid head jabs of the chicken walk. 

One day, while strutting around the chicken farm, the young eagle sees something soaring through the sky. The flying creature has long wings, which it stretches wide before tucking them in and angling downward to dive toward the earth. The sight of this other-worldly bird stirs something in the young eagle. 

Over the next few weeks, the eagle can‚Äôt shake the vision of the soaring bird from its mind. At feeding time, it wonders out loud, ‚ÄúWhat if we tried to fly more than two feet off the ground?‚Äù The other chickens stare back. The young eagle isn't sure if these stares are ambivalence or the default chicken eye position. So, it begins to ponder the only way forward. It must learn to fly high while living with its chicken family.

This is both a book for educators and a book about learning to program in R. It‚Äôs for folks who feel at home in the education community but are also wondering how to use data better. It‚Äôs about being an educator and wondering if it‚Äôs too late to learn to code. And it‚Äôs about being an educator learning to code and wondering if there are others to learn with. 

We were on social media a lot in November of 2017. We talked about things like debugging code, interpreting model coefficients, and working on spreadsheets with too many rows. We kept coming back to these topics over and over again. It was like having an obscure hobby with online friends because it‚Äôs hard to find local knitters who only knit Friends characters or vinyl collectors who only collect Swedish disco albums. 

When you work as a data science consultant in education or as an educator learning data science, it‚Äôs hard to find a professional community that gets you. Attending education conferences is great, but the eyes glaze over when you talk about regression models. The data science conferences are super, but folks leave the cocktail table when you vent about the state of aggregate test score data. 

We started talking about data science in education online because we wanted to be around folks who do data science in education. We wrote this book for you, so you can learn data science with datasets you can find in education work. We don‚Äôt claim to be experts at education or data science, but we‚Äôre pretty good at talking about what it‚Äôs like to do both in a meaningful way. 

So give your chicken family a big hug, open up your laptop, and let‚Äôs start learning together. Turns out, there are a lot more hatchlings wanting to be eagles and chickens at the same time.
