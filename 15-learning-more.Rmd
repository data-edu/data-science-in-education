# Learning More

While this book aims to serve as an introduction to data science in education, there is much more to learn.

## A growth mindset

Doing data science and using R are hard. Moreover, both are changing rapidly and it can feel difficult to keep up.

We suggest trying to take a *growth mindset* to learning data science. In Dweck's characterization, when it comes to our capabilities, we can think of ourselves as *being* (and *not being*) mathematics or reading people, with this being an unchangeable part of who we are. Conversely, we can think of ourselves as being more or less capable depending on how much we want to be, who we are around, and how much effort we exert. The former way of thinking is a *fixed* mindset, whereas the latter is a *growth* mindset. 

We would like to suggest that having a growth mindset is especially helpful for learning more about data science. Partially, this is because what data science is is still being discussed: and so nobody is born a data scientist! More importantly, individuals come to data science - and make contributions to data science - with many different backgrounds, many of them unrelated to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) backgrounds. This is a strength of the data science field as it exists now and we think this should be nurtured.
