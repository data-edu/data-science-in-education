If you're reading this book cover to cover, by now you've been through quite a journey. 
You've learned about the unique challenges of doing data science in education, you've built up some basic coding and statistic techniques to begin developing and using an analytic routine, you've practiced your skills on education datasets, and you've worked out a plan to introduce data science into your education organization over time. So what's next? 

Like most industries, education and data science are constantly evolving moving through trends and new knowledge. That means that today's tools and best practices are tomorrow's old way. To keep up with changes, it is important develop and get comfortable with a learning routine. Sometimes this is about learning something new, sometimes this is about deepening expertise in an area you're just starting in, and other times it's about revisiting a skill you've mastered long ago. 

You'll need to use your intuition to find the areas you want to deepend your knowledge. When you feel it, go there and dive in. Remember that learning is a combination of reading, doing, talking about, walking away, and coming back. Here are more resources to help you continue on your journey: 

It's helpful to construct your own system for continuous learning. The components of this system are sources of information, learning communities, places to share your work, and a schedule to structure your learning. 

*Sources of information* 

Continuous learning about using data science at your education work place means consuming high quality books, blog posts, journals, journalism, and talks. It also means having a way that you discover new content to learn from. In his book *Steal Like An Artist*, author Austin Kleon encourages people to surround themselves with great content: 

>“There’s an economic theory out there that if you take the incomes of your five closest friends and average them, the resulting number will be pretty close to your own income. I think the same thing is true of our idea incomes. You’re only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with.”

So with that in mind, here are some examples that we love. Start with these and go find more!

# Learning More

While this book aims to serve as an introduction to data science in education,
there is much more to learn. Welcoming others, sharing one's work, asking for and providing help, and taking a growth mindset are ways to improve and diversify your skills.

## Working in the open

Working in the open is a great way to learn more. The R community is very receptive to giving advice, sharing code, and giving feedback. As members of this community, we can reap the benefits of learning from others and sharing our knowledge as well.

### Welcoming others

One strength of the data science community (at least the corner of it that the
authors of this book occupy) is that it can be a welcoming place. This is due to the
hard work of many of the members of the data science community, who actively participate, react, and praise others. In order for the data science community to continue to be welcoming - and to be more welcoming to those for whom it is currently not - it's important for all of us to continue to work toward a data science community that is inclusive of those who wish to be involved.

Particularly for those of us in education, there are many opportunities to bring others in our field into the community. Welcoming others has the benefit of positioning you as someone with (even if it is still-developing) expertise in data science and R. Teaching others, or even helping others to get started, is a great way to learn more about one's understanding and to learn more in the process. Showing the analyses that you've done and the decisions you've influenced can showcase the value that data science and programming can bring.

One thing to be aware of: You may end up liking data science so much that you become an evangelist (and may, if you are like us, on occasion, make people think you are a bit crazy for R!). This is one thing to keep in mind in regard to welcoming others: People will want to use data science at different times and for different reasons. Focus on welcoming those who are curious and ready to learn more. For those who are skeptical, be patient and open to hearing their concerns and hesitations.

### Sharing one's work

A great way to learn more is to openly share one's work. Your work could include a cool function you invented, an interesting visualization you created, or a package you like. It can be more abstract, such as the workflow you have for your work or your experience at a recent data science event. Anything that you learned or found interesting would be relevant to others too!

The first concern that many of us have about sharing our work in the open is that it is imperfect. This is a dilemma that everyone manages differently. Some data scientist's blog posts are very polished and article-like, whereas others are comfortable sharing ideas-in-progress or shorter posts. The consensus is that regardless of whether your work is refined or not, it is valuable to share your work with the data science community.

Sharing is an opportunity to show off what you know and opens you up to feedback so that you can hone your skills. Depending on how you share, you can also create a portfolio of your work. There are many ways to share your work, including:

* Twitter using the hashtag #rstats
* Creating a blog. An excellent walkthrough of why to start a blog is David Robinson's [Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/).

Especially for sharing work related to data science, there are blogging platforms that make it easy to publish code, its output, and text. For example, there is an R package called *[blogdown]*(https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) that creates websites using R Markdown and a static website creator called Hugo. *blogdown* makes it easy to create, run, and publish code directly from R Studio. Alison Hill at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) has a great introduction on getting up and running with Blogdown [here](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/).

Once you have something to share, whether in a blogpost or a tweet, reach out to the community to broadcast what you have to say! In addition to the hashtag #rstats mentioned above, you can "at" a package or package creator that you mentioned. There are also blog aggregators that can help disseminate your blogposts to a wider audience.

* R Weekly newsletter [https://rweekly.org/](https://rweekly.org/)
* R Bloggers [https://www.r-bloggers.com](https://www.r-bloggers.com)

Finally, share the love! Retweet others, leave comments, and interact with the vibrant data science and R communities.

## Asking for and receiving help

There are a number of platforms for asking for and receiving help. They are also
great places to learn more. 

When working with a specific package, you can always go to the Github repository to learn more about how to use the package and its functions. Some packages also have their own package websites. For instance, *dplyr*'s Github repo is https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr. The README and vignettes offer an overview of the functions available and what they do. If so inclined, you can dig into the code that makes the package possible (and add to it yourself!). You can also look at the [Issues](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues) page to see what is yet to be resolved for the package (this is useful if you're running into a problem on the list and to see the status of its resolution). If you run into an issue that doesn't seem to have a solution, you can contribute by adding an issue. To learn more about contributing to packages, check out Kara Woo's talk [Anyone can play git/R: Tips for first-time contributions to R packages](https://speakerdeck.com/karawoo/r-tips-for-first-time-contributions-to-r-packages).

A package's vignette offers long-form documentation for its functions. These are incredibly helpful as they often outline how to use a function and examples as well. In addition to going to the Github repo to find a vignette, you can run ??function in RStudio to pull it up (for example, ??mutate).

Questions and answers from sites such as [R Studio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are often among the first places that are returned from a search on a topic. Searching through questions is a great way to improve your coding skills, as you can modify replies to apply to the situation you are facing. Asking questions on these platforms is another way to get help specific to the problem you are facing.

One helpful strategy when asking a question is to include a *reprex*, a reproducible
example. This allows others to recreate your error/issue so they can better help you fix it. See Jenny Bryan's page with resources related to reprexes
[here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/video-reproducible-examples-and-the-reprex-package/14732).

Of course, answering questions is also a great way to help others - and to learn
more about the challenges others face and how to approach specific problems in
the process.

## Adopting a growth mindset

Doing data science and using R can be difficult. Moreover, both are changing rapidly and
it can feel difficult to keep up.

We suggest taking a *growth mindset* to learning data science. In [Carol Dweck's](https://mindsetonline.com/abouttheauthor/)
characterization, when it comes to our capabilities, we can think of ourselves
as *being* (and *not being*) mathematics or reading people, with this being an
unchangeable part of who we are. Conversely, we can think of ourselves as being
more or less capable depending on how much we want to be, who we are around, and
how much effort we exert. The former way of thinking is a *fixed* mindset,
whereas the latter is a *growth* mindset. As educators, we would be remiss not
to mention some of the critiques (and concerns) about focusing exclusively on a
growth mindset (see this post
[here](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/09/23/carol-dweck-revisits-the-growth-mindset.html)), but it can be a useful idea when used narrowly and as a spark to push ourselves further.

We would like to suggest that having a growth mindset is especially helpful for learning more about data science. Partially, this is because what data science "is" is still being discussed, and so nobody is born a data scientist! More importantly, individuals come to data science - and make contributions to data science - with many different backgrounds, many of them unrelated to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) backgrounds. This is a strength of the data science field as it exists now and we think this should be nurtured.
